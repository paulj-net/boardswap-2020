# boardswap-2020

This repo contains design files for my contribution to the 2019/2020 boardswap series.  More details on our boardswap can be found on the Boldport Club Discord Server.

A little history on the project...  I got my start in electronics building guitar effects kits.  I've always been fascinated by audio and electronics.  This little circuit was orginally going to be a variation of an Atari Punk Console (hence some of the filenames) but it ended up just being a simple little one octave keyboard with a focus on correct pitch.  The circuit is tuned for proper note steps with the pot in the middle position.  Due to the type of circuit employed the steps between keys change as you move farther from the middle position.  It's not perfect, I'd change a few of the pads to make soldering easier.  I'd also spin the pot 180 degrees and experiment with other speakers.  The particular speaker chosen has a resonant frequency that is hit fairly easily as you play the instrument.  My kids love when that happens, I see it as an area for improvement.  In any case I hope you enjoy it!

Design files were all created in KiCad.
